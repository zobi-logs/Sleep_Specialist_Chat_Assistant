56771163,Borderline leprosy,Borderline leprosy is seen in patients with levels of cell-mediated immune response to Mycobacterium leprae intermediate between those found in tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy. This designation may be used for those cases which have not been further categorized as borderline tuberculoid or borderline lepromatous and for those categorized as mid-borderline (BB) leprosy. Lesions typically consist of annular plaques with an erythematous infiltrated rim and an almost normal looking centre. Borderline leprosy is inherently unstable and may transform towards either polar end depending on the individual's immune response to infection [Dermatology TAG].
1888276943,Borderline lepromatous leprosy,"Borderline lepromatous (BL) leprosy is similar to lepromatous leprosy but the presence of some cell-mediated immune response to infection prevents the unfettered proliferation of bacilli in the skin. It is characterised by large numbers of poorly-defined macules, papules and plaques with a tendency to be distributed symmetrically. Neuropathy tends to be of a diffuse ""glove and stocking"" type. Initiation of treatment, however, may be accompanied by recovery of cell-mediated immunity and a risk of severe nerve damage (upgrading reaction/Type I reaction) [Dermatology TAG]."
365370459,Lepromatous leprosy,"Lepromatous leprosy occurs in individuals with a poor or absent cell-mediated immune response to infection with Mycobacterium leprae. This allows the bacillae to multiply unhindered in skin and nerves (multibacillary leprosy). It is characterised by multiple poorly defined erythematous macules, papules, nodules and plaques which are distributed widely but usually symmetrically over the body. The face and limbs are sites of predilection. A symmetrical peripheral neuropathy of the hands and feet is commonly present [Dermatology TAG]."
1487561185,Lucio type diffuse lepromatous leprosy,"Diffuse lepromatous leprosy (Lucio-Latapi leprosy) is a special form of lepromatous leprosy found only in Central America, where it is the predominant type. It is distinguished by widespread, diffuse infiltration of the skin by leprosy bacilli without formation of nodules or plaques. This may produce a full ""baby-face"" appearance and loss of eyebrows. Patients are predisposed to a fulminant type II leprosy reaction which can result in widespread cutaneous infarction (Lucio phenomenon) [Dermatology TAG]."

1185467033,Type I leprosy reaction,"This phenomenon, also named “upgrading reaction,” occurs in borderline leprosy states and is associated with an increase in cell-mediated immunity. It occurs typically within the first 6 months of treatment in previously untreated patients but may be related to stress, intercurrent infections, or pregnancy. Clinical features include inflammatory swelling, erythema and occasionally ulceration of existing lesions, constitutional symptoms and neuritis. If the neuritis is not treated promptly permanent motor nerve damage may ensue."
1886317801,Type II leprosy reaction,"This phenomenon, also named downgrading reaction, occurs in borderline leprosy states and is associated with a decrease in cell-mediated immunity with a shift towards the lepromatous end of the clinical spectrum."
1678551661,Erythema nodosum leprosum,"Erythema nodosum leprosum is a necrotizing vasculitis involving small to medium-sized vessels of the deep dermis and subcutis. It is provoked by an immune complex-mediated response to release of mycobacterial antigens from effete bacilli in patients with multibacillary leprosy (lepromatous and borderline lepromatous), usually after initiation of treatment."
2085564053,Lucio phenomenon,A type II leprosy reaction occurring exclusively in patients with Lucio type diffuse lepromatous leprosy and manifesting as numerous areas of cutaneous infarction.

It affects the skin and bones, is spread by skin to skin contact, and is not sexually transmitted, but cannot be distinguished serologically from syphilis."
3933330,Primary yaws,"Primary yaws results from primary inoculation of Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue into the skin, manifesting 2-12 weeks later as a localised papule (initial, primary or ‘mother' yaw) before developing into a large non-tender ulcerating nodule, often resembling a raspberry (hence the name ‘framboesia’). The primary lesion is most commonly located on the legs and ankles may also be found on the buttocks, arms, hands, and face. It usually heals after 3–6 months and is still present at the onset of the secondary stage in only a minority (9-15%)."
944473231,Secondary yaws,"Secondary yaws results from lymphatic and haematogenous spread of Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue spirochaetes from the initial inoculation site and appears from a few weeks to 2 years after the primary infection. The commonest initial symptoms are non-specific and include arthralgia and malaise. Secondary skin lesions consist of multiple papules and nodules similar to the initial lesion but smaller. They may be localised, regional or generalised; they may ulcerate and on moist areas may mimic syphilitic condylomata lata. Hyperkeratotic plaques on the palms and soles may develop painful fissures and secondary infection, resulting in a characteristic ‘crab-like’ gait."
651830885,Osteoperiostitis due to secondary yaws,"Osteoperiostitis occurring during the course of secondary yaws typically presents with nocturnal bone pain and swelling affecting either the proximal phalanges of the ?fingers (dactylitis) or the long bones (forearm, tibia or fibula). The process normally affects several bones and is thus polyostotic; early bone changes are usually visible by plain radiography and periosteal thickening is often palpable. In contrast with the destructive osteitis of tertiary yaws, the osteoperiostitis of secondary yaws is generally reversible following treatment."

1353189551,Human immunodeficiency virus disease associated with generalised lymphadenopathy,"This is a lentivirus (slowly replicating retrovirus) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. This is a disease resulting in (persistent) generalised lymphadenopathy."
904119611,Acute human immunodeficiency virus infection syndrome,"This syndrome is the initial manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One half to two thirds of patients present with an acute ""mononucleosis-type"" illness (fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, rash, headache, malaise, arthralgia, or myalgia) often with a truncal exanthem. Symptoms generally resolve within 10-15 days. Transmission is by sexual contact, direct contact, iatrogenic transmission, or vertical transmission. Confirmation is by identification of human immunodeficiency virus in a blood sample."

647697202,HIV-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) results from pathological immune responses occurring during immune reconstitution and is strongly associated with antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection and AIDS. There is a wide range of clinical manifestations, incorporating disease resulting from a pathological inflammatory reaction to pathogens such as tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, immune-mediated inflammatory disease and autoimmune disease. Clinical effects range from a mild, self-limiting illness to severe morbidity and mortality."

This is a disease resulting in immunological abnormalities, not elsewhere classified."
1280360496,Human immunodeficiency virus disease associated with lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis,"This is a lentivirus (slowly replicating retrovirus) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. This is a disease resulting in a syndrome secondary to autoimmune and other lymphoproliferative disorders."
386699845,Human immunodeficiency virus disease enteritis,"This is an inflammation of small intestine associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In diarrhoea, a major complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, the etiology of which is often obscure."
49124354,Gastritis due to human immunodeficiency virus disease,This condition is the inflammation of the stomach due to HIV disease.
823589549,Myelitis due to Human immunodeficiency virus,"An inflammatory disorder of the spinal cord due to infection by the HIV virus. The symptoms and signs may be acute or subacute in onset, and include paraparesis or paraplegia, sensory loss appropriate with the level of the spinal cord affected, and loss of sphincter control. Diagnosis may be confirmed by neuroimaging, spinal fluid analysis, serological tests, and PCR assay."
